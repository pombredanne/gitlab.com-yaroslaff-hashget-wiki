## hashserver client

separate hashserver HashDB:
- How to store caches? how to know name of other project (_cached)? or different caches?
- Need to avoid query hashserver if have it locally
- if fetched hashpackage, where to store it? how to get access to object?
- sometimes need to create project
- how to get project name from URL? (generate?)


Maybe URL option for DirHashDB? 
- Need to avoid query hashserver if have it locally


## self-hash (and cool name for it) 

## Community-supplied data

## uploading?
need uploader and how to verify if Release matches date (and not for other day)
