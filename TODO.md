# TODO

- heuristics (e.g. detect wordpress and kernel.org packages)
- hint files (.hashget-hint) with URLs what to hash
- convert hashdb to .json files, also make it more unified (e.g. files should be sorted)
- make docs for format of .hashget-restore and HashPackages
- make docs for classes
- Fingerprinting utility for file/directory (recursive, with --exclude)
